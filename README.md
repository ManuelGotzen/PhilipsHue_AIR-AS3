Hue AIR
=======
Access the Philips Hue Bridge through AS3/AIR.
At the moment this project is still in the early stages, under active development and subject to change rapidly.
The full API has been implemented, so you can control lights, groups and schedules through the HueConnector class. 

A basic (read: fugly) MXML interface is in place.
